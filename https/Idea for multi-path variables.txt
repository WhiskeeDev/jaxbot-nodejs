- split the routeName by '/' and split q.pathname by '/'.
- all splits starting with ':' are considered variables.
- record the positions of variables.
- compare the number of routeName.splits to the number q.pathname.splits.
- compare the routeName.splits before variables to the q.pathname.splits.
- if match, save variables using the positions from routeName.splits and take value from q.pathname.splits.
